## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

<summary><strong>About Me</strong></summary>

My name is [Jay Sueno](www.linkedin.com/in/jaysueno) and I'm a novice data scientist with a [certificate](https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/data/) from UC San Diego in Data Science and Visualization. I believe that <strong>artifical intelligence</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> are the next industrial revolution and can be a cause for good in the world. It's up to humans like you and me to guide that future. 

One of the paradigms I ascribe to is <strong>intersectional activism</strong> to solve the challenges of our world. Climate change, inequality, environmental justice, technology, education, race, and human ingenuity are interconnected. I believe that through data and information, we can make the right choices.
